# Learning general policies from examples

This repository implements the algorithm described in the KR 2025 paper for learning general policies from examples.
By using a novel termination criterion, the resulting rule-based policies are structurally terminating by design.
When the algoirthm fails, the reason for failure is provided.

The code is built upon the a code by Dominik Drexler for learning general sketches. Both learners have some
code in common, but their approaches are completely different.
